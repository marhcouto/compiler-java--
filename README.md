**Global Grade of the Project:** 18.2

## Summary

Our project is able to compile a file written in Java-- language (.jmm file extension)
defined in the project's handout, to a Jasmin file (.j extension). The resulting file can be then transformed into java bytecode (.class file) through the use of jasmin.jar. 
Finally, the .class file originated can be run with java. 

The compiler we designed and constructed is divided into 4 steps:
- Syntactic Analysis
- Semantic Analysis
- Ollir Code Generation
- Jasmin Code Generation

The compilation process takes into account the structure and semantic validity of the file given, 
raising errors or warning when guidelines for the language are not met. Our project also
implements optimizations, both in Ollir Code Generation and Jasmin Code Generation stages.

## Syntactic-Analysis

We defined the grammar in the file javacc/JmmGrammer.jj. The SimpleParser class is used to parse
the program given, generating an AST and detecting any syntactical errors along the way.

## Semantic-Analysis

### Symbol Table

For the Semantic Analysis part, our project resorts to the use of a Symbol Table. This symbol table contains:
- Import paths
- Class name
- Super class if exists
- A table (Java Map) mapping each field's name string to its type and other information (Symbol class)
- A table (Java Map) mapping each method's name string to an instance of Method. Each method has:
    - A table (Java Map) mapping each parameter/local variable's name string to its type and other information (ExtendedSymbol class)
    - Return Type

This symbol table is generated with visitors that traverse the AST created in the previous step.

### Analysis

Semantic Analysis is also performed using visitors to visit the AST, using the data stored
in the Symbol Table to perform type checks and other operations.

Rules ensured by semantic analysis:

**ERRORS:**
- Check if an array access is being done to a variable that is not an array
- Check if a variable is assigned a valid type
- Check if a variable has been declared before its use
- Check if this is accessed in main (as it is a static method, it should not)
- Check if access to property length is done to just array variables
- Check that the operators of binary operations and unary operations (symmetry (-) and negativity (!)) have valid types
- Check if the condition of a loop is boolean
- Check if a method call is performed on a variable that has that method and if the arguments are correct. If the class has a super class we consider all method calls valid because our compiler can't do type checking on imported classes. 
- Check if array is created with size of type int
- Check if in an assignment the value assigned has the correct typing
- Check if value returned by a method has correct typing (same as the one declared)

**WARNINGS:**
- Check if a variable has been assigned a value before it is used

A warning is used in this situation as there is no way of being sure that the value has not
been assigned a value without checking the flow of the program


## Code Generation
Our program takes a file with Java-- code inside and then, by using the improved grammar without left recursion and with left factorization we create an AST composed by JmmNodes that represent the initial code.

We take that AST and create a symbol table with information regarding imports, classes, class fields, methods and local variables.

Then we take the AST and the Symbol Table and perform semantic analysis enforcing the rules mentioned above. We chose to use a rich AST to ease the development of OLLIR code, so during this phase we add information on each node about its scope and type. If that analysis fail we terminate the compilation flow.

If the program is considered valid by our semantic rules then we create the OLLIR code. During this phase we might perform optimizations if the user chose to do so.

At the end of the compiler flow we translate the OLLIR code into Jasmin code and perform optimization such as the use of 'const' instructions.

The output of our compiler is a single .j file with jasmin code that must be later converted by the user to JVM bytecode by using the jar file found at libs folder.

## Pros
- Compiles any Java-- file to Jasmin 
- Supports negative numbers
- Is able to perform constant propagation
- Is able to perform instruction selection such as 'bipush', 'iconst', comparations with 0, uses 'iload' and 'istore', 'sipush', iinc
- Is able to perform constant folding with arithmetic expressions and comparations in Jasmin
- Is able to perform short-circuit evaluation of boolean expressions in Jasmin
- Is able to perform strength reduction in multiplication/divisions by factors of 2 in Jasmin
- Is able to perform minimization of *gotos* in *while loops* (integrated in base ollir generation, no need for '-o' flag)

## Cons
- Does not support overloading (cause of failed tests)
- Does not use Register Allocation (cause of failed tests)

## Extra tests
Extra tests were created to further increase the testing of the tool and to showcase some 
implementation details:

- Jasmin Optimization
- Semantic Analysis
- Jasmin Edges Cases
- Test to show minimization of gotos optimization, as the ones presented failed due to not
considering 'ifne' an if statement on jasmin

**Note:** the tests are located in the folder test/pt/up/fe/comp/extra.

## Compile options

- '-d' debug mode disables output of jasmin to a file
- '-v' enables print from the different compiling phases
- '-o' enables constant propagation optimizations

[//]: # (Fo this project, you need to install [Java]&#40;https://jdk.java.net/&#41;, [Gradle]&#40;https://gradle.org/install/&#41;, and [Git]&#40;https://git-scm.com/downloads/&#41; &#40;and optionally, a [Git GUI client]&#40;https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis&#41;, such as TortoiseGit or GitHub Desktop&#41;. Please check the [compatibility matrix]&#40;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html&#41; for Java and Gradle versions.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Project setup)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (There are three important subfolders inside the main folder. First, inside the subfolder named ``javacc`` you will find the initial grammar definition. Then, inside the subfolder named ``src`` you will find the entry point of the application. Finally, the subfolder named ``tutorial`` contains code solutions for each step of the tutorial. JavaCC21 will generate code inside the subfolder ``generated``.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Compile and Running)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (To compile and install the program, run ``gradle installDist``. This will compile your classes and create a launcher script in the folder ``./build/install/comp2022-00/bin``. For convenience, there are two script files, one for Windows &#40;``comp2022-00.bat``&#41; and another for Linux &#40;``comp2022-00``&#41;, in the root folder, that call tihs launcher script.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (After compilation, a series of tests will be automatically executed. The build will stop if any test fails. Whenever you want to ignore the tests and build the program anyway, you can call Gradle with the flag ``-x test``.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Test)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (To test the program, run ``gradle test``. This will execute the build, and run the JUnit tests in the ``test`` folder. If you want to see output printed during the tests, use the flag ``-i`` &#40;i.e., ``gradle test -i``&#41;.)

[//]: # (You can also see a test report by opening ``./build/reports/tests/test/index.html``.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (## Checkpoint 1)

[//]: # (For the first checkpoint the following is required:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (1. Convert the provided e-BNF grammar into JavaCC grammar format in a .jj file)

[//]: # (2. Resolve grammar conflicts, preferably with lookaheads no greater than 2)

[//]: # (3. Include missing information in nodes &#40;i.e. tree annotation&#41;. E.g. include the operation type in the operation node.)

[//]: # (4. Generate a JSON from the AST)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### JavaCC to JSON)

[//]: # (To help converting the JavaCC nodes into a JSON format, we included in this project the JmmNode interface, which can be seen in ``src-lib/pt/up/fe/comp/jmm/ast/JmmNode.java``. The idea is for you to use this interface along with the Node class that is automatically generated by JavaCC &#40;which can be seen in ``generated``&#41;. Then, one can easily convert the JmmNode into a JSON string by invoking the method JmmNode.toJson&#40;&#41;.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Please check the JavaCC tutorial to see an example of how the interface can be implemented.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### Reports)

[//]: # (We also included in this project the class ``src-lib/pt/up/fe/comp/jmm/report/Report.java``. This class is used to generate important reports, including error and warning messages, but also can be used to include debugging and logging information. E.g. When you want to generate an error, create a new Report with the ``Error`` type and provide the stage in which the error occurred.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### Parser Interface)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (We have included the interface ``src-lib/pt/up/fe/comp/jmm/parser/JmmParser.java``, which you should implement in a class that has a constructor with no parameters &#40;please check ``src/pt/up/fe/comp/CalculatorParser.java`` for an example&#41;. This class will be used to test your parser. The interface has a single method, ``parse``, which receives a String with the code to parse, and returns a JmmParserResult instance. This instance contains the root node of your AST, as well as a List of Report instances that you collected during parsing.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (To configure the name of the class that implements the JmmParser interface, use the file ``config.properties``.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### Compilation Stages )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The project is divided in four compilation stages, that you will be developing during the semester. The stages are Parser, Analysis, Optimization and Backend, and for each of these stages there is a corresponding Java interface that you will have to implement &#40;e.g. for the Parser stage, you have to implement the interface JmmParser&#41;.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # ()
[//]: # (### config.properties)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The testing framework, which uses the class TestUtils located in ``src-lib/pt/up/fe/comp``, has methods to test each of the four compilation stages &#40;e.g., ``TestUtils.parse&#40;&#41;`` for testing the Parser stage&#41;. )

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (In order for the test class to find your implementations for the stages, it uses the file ``config.properties`` that is in root of your repository. It has four fields, one for each stage &#40;i.e. ``ParserClass``, ``AnalysisClass``, ``OptimizationClass``, ``BackendClass``&#41;, and initially it only has one value, ``pt.up.fe.comp.SimpleParser``, associated with the first stage.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (During the development of your compiler you will update this file in order to setup the classes that implement each of the compilation stages.)
